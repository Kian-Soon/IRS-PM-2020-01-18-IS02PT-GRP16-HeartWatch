## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally and 17 people in Singapore die from CVD every day. A doctor has a wide variety of non-invasive and invasive tests at his disposal to diagnose CVD patients. These tests can be expensive and time-consuming for both the patient and the doctor. Therefore, a doctor needs to figure out the most efficient method to predict onset of CVD in his patients. 

Our team proposes here an application that is able to quickly diagnose if a patient might contract CVD with a few targeted queries about some clinical measures and lifestyle practices of the patient. The application matches the information provided about the patient with a rule engine that is constructed in consideration to a decision tree model trained using a historical dataset of patients, some of who may have CVD. This application is user-friendly as it guides the user through a dedicated set of queries.  The user can quickly derive a first prediction about the patient’s possibility of contracting CVD, which can be a critical and timely reminder to initiate further medical investigations.  Such pre-emptive efforts that can be realized with this system may help to save more lives, via an early warning process.

A short questionnaire designed from rules derived from a historical dataset of CVD predictors. A doctor will order a single non-invasive test, the Thallium stress test, and few more non-invasive tests as required by the questionnaire. Based on the rules set by our machine learning algorithm, the questionnaire is able to predict the onset of CVD.
